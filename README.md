# <img src="resources/splash.svg" width="280" /> <br/> QA Engineering Challenge

Welcome to the Splash QA coding challenge. This challenge is not meant to be long, complicated, or convoluted. Instead this test is short and seeks to identify your thoroughness as a tester. 

## Challenge Description

Using Selenium, implement an automated test suite to cover our login flow. Use this account to login:
* Username: qacandidate@splashthat.com
* Password: testingislife

You are free to disregard the Facebook login feature. For development, you can use either the Selenium IDE or Selenium WebDriver in Python, Java, or Ruby. This repository provides you with barebones scripts to get started with any of those.

## Getting Started
1. *Fork this Repository*&mdash;Don't worry! Your fork will remain private in your GitHub account.
2. *Add Collaborators.* Go to `Settings > Collaborators & Teams` and add the Splash team: @stephanie-splash and @greggilbert
3. *Submit your solution.* You will be completing the challenge in the forked repo and sending a link to your repo when you're finished. Avoid opening pull requests.

## Setup Instructions
1. Download the Selenium IDE or WebDriver Language Bindings of your choosing here: https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/#selenium_ide
2. A) If using the IDE, open up the `splashqachallenge.side` project in the selenium_ide folder
<br /> B) If using the Webdriver, open the text editor of your choice and navigate to the folder that corresponds to the language of your choice
3. Have fun!

## Challenge Goals

We'll go over your challenge during your onsite interview, so make sure you produce something you're proud of and be ready to explain the methodoligy used to develop the test.
