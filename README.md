# <img src="resources/splash.svg" width="280" /> <br/> QA Engineering Challenge

Welcome to the Splash QA coding challenge. This challenge is not meant to be long, complicated, or convoluted. Instead this test is short and seeks to identify your thoroughness as a tester. 

## Challenge Description

Using Selenium, implement an automated test suite to cover our login flow. Here is the login page URL: `https://splashthat.com/login`. Use this account to login:
* Username: qacandidate@splashthat.com
* Password: testingislife

You are free to disregard the Facebook login feature. For development, you can use either the Selenium IDE or Selenium WebDriver in Python or Ruby. This repository provides you with barebones scripts to get started with any of those.

## Setup Instructions
1. Download the Selenium IDE or WebDriver Language Bindings of your choosing here: https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/#selenium_ide
2. A) If using the IDE, open up the `splashqachallenge.side` project in the selenium_ide folder
<br /> B) If using the Webdriver, open the text editor of your choice and navigate to the folder that corresponds to the language of your choice
3. Have fun!

## Submitting your work
You may submit your work via zip via the Greenhouse link that was included in the email directing you to this test, or you may upload your code to GitHub as a private repository and *add Splash Collaborators.* Go to `Settings > Collaborators & Teams` and add the Splash team: @stephanie-splash and @greggilbert

## Challenge Goals

We'll go over your challenge during your onsite interview, so make sure you produce something you're proud of and be ready to explain the methodoligy used to develop the test.
